==================================================================
3. Troubleshooting
==================================================================

There are several things you can do to make sure that your computer system realizes the full potential of the program.


1.  Determine if any changes have been made to the system.

A frequent source of conflict between hardware and software is a system configuration change. If an error occurs after making a change to the configuration of your system (i.e., adding new hardware, updating drivers, installing another program), then that system change is a likely source of the problem. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions to verify that the proper installation procedure was used and note any incompatibility issue or system modifications listed in the documentation.


2.  Isolate the source of the problem.

The program itself does not necessarily cause errors that occur when running a software program. These errors may be caused by the operating system, a conflict between hardware settings, another program running in the background, or an obsolete driver, which has not been updated to work with the system’s newer components. Determine exactly when and where the problem occurs, and whether or not the problem also occurs with other software programs. Also determine what other system activities are taking place when the problem occurs. Determining the exact circumstances under which a problem occurs often points to a solution.


3.  Determine if the error can be reproduced.

Restart the program and test for the error. If the same error occurs in the same location, uninstall the program, reinstall the program, restart the system, and then run the program again. If the error recurs, determine if a similar error occurs with other software programs. If it does, the source of the problem may be one of the system’s hardware components. Refer to your hardware documentation or contact the manufacturer to determine if an updated driver or system modification will resolve the issue.


4.  Verify that your system meets or exceeds the minimum system requirements of the program. 

If your system does not meet any one of the minimum requirements, the program will not run properly.


5.  Verify that all external cables and connections are secure. 

Also ensure that power, settings, and option controls for all system components are set appropriately. Refer to your hardware documentation or consult your hardware manufacturer for additional information.


6.  Exit all other programs and applications when installing or running the program.

Exit any active screen savers, utility programs, anti-virus programs, or shell programs to ensure that the maximum amount of RAM is available for your system to run the program as quickly and smoothly as possible. Also exit any automatic power saving
utilities or other timing programs like an anti-virus program that scans your hard disk every hour or a power management utility that shuts down all non-essential system functions during idle periods. If a timing program or screen saver activates during installation or during play, the program may crash or experience other technical
difficulties.

NOTE:

If you encounter a black box on the screen after setting the screen resolution to 1280 x 1024 in windowed mode, the issue can be resolved by setting the screen resolution to any other valid resolution and then switching back. 
Do not change the screen resolution to any setting higher than your monitor can support; otherwise no images will display on your monitor. 

==================================================================
4. DirectX 9.0c Troubleshooting
==================================================================

This program is designed to use Microsoft's DirectX 9.0c or higher technology, which provides components and drivers to enhance every aspect of high performance applications.

In order to run this program with the best possible performance, your video card and sound card should be DirectX 9.0c-compatible with certified DirectX 9.0c drivers properly installed. If you experience sound or display difficulties, a likely source of the issue is an outdated or incompatible driver.

To verify that you have DirectX 9.0c certified drivers installed on your system, run the DirectX Diagnostics (DXDIAG) program that is copied to your hard drive when this program is installed. This program displays version and status information for your sound and display drivers, as well as all other DirectX components installed on your system.


--- To open the DirectX Diagnostics Tool, proceed as follows:

From the Windows Taskbar, click on Start and select Run.

In the Open: field, type DXDIAG. Click on OK or press the Enter key on your keyboard. The program will begin to gather information about your system and the Diagnostics Tool will open with the System tab in the foreground.


When DXDIAG starts, the following tabs will be displayed: System, DirectX Files, Display, Sound, Music, Input, Network, and More Help.

- The System tab contains system information about the computer and specifies the version of DirectX installed on your computer. The system information includes: system date, computer name, operating system version and language, processor type, memory, swapfile size, and DirectX version.

- The DirectX Files tab contains the filenames and version numbers for all DirectX files installed on the computer. If DXDIAG detects any problems with any DirectX files, a warning will be displayed in the Notes box.

- The Display tab contains detailed information about your display settings, and allows you to disable hardware acceleration for DirectDraw, Direct3D, and AGP Texture. On this tab, you can also test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and AGP Texturing. If DXDIAG detects any problems with any display settings or driver files, a warning will be displayed in the Notes box. Be sure to note the Name of your video card and the amount of video RAM that it contains.

- The Sound tab contains detailed information about the sound card settings and driver.  On this tab, you can test DirectSound and lower the Sound Hardware Acceleration Level.  If DXDIAG detects any problems with the sound card or driver files, a warning will be displayed in the Notes box.

- The Music tab contains the current MIDI settings. On this tab, you can test DirectMusic.  If DXDIAG detects any problems with any MIDI settings, a warning will be displayed in the Notes box.

- The Input tab contains the input devices (Joystick, Gamepad, Steering Wheel) connected to the computer and the input drivers installed on the computer.

- The Network tab contains a list of the Network drivers installed and running on the computer. From this tab you may test DirectPlay.


At any time during the troubleshooting, the DirectX information can be saved to a text file by clicking on the Save All Information button.


NOTE: If your sound and display drivers are not listed as Certified, contact your computer manufacturer to verify that the drivers currently installed on your system are the latest available and that they are compatible with DirectX. If Certified drivers are not available, drivers that are compatible, but not certified, should run the program with an acceptable level of performance. If your sound and video card drivers are not compatible with DirectX, the program may not run properly.
